Creating a mapped network drive allows you to quickly access files and folders on a shared network as if they were on your local machine. Fortunately, Windows 10 lets you map network drives in just a few simple steps.

## Map a Network Drive

With network discovery turned on, you can now map a network drive. First, open File Explorer and then click “This PC” in the left-hand pane.

Next, click “Map Network Drive” in the Network group of the Computer tab.

The Map Network Drive window will appear. In the text box next to “Drive,” select the drive letter that you’d like to use. You can use any letter that’s not currently used on your device. Type the folder or computer path in the “Folder” text box, or click “Browse” and choose the device from the pop-up that appears. You can also select “Reconnect at Sign-in” if you’d like to connect each time you log in to your device.

Once you’ve set that up, click “Finish” and the network drive will be mapped on your device.

## How to Map a Network Drive in Windows 10 ?

1. Open File Explorer and select This PC.
2. Click the Map network drive drop-down in the ribbon menu at the top, then select "Map network drive." 
3. Select the drive letter you want to use for the network folder, then hit Browse.
4. If you receive an error message, then you'll need to turn on network discovery. To do so, open the Control Panel, select Network and Sharing Center and choose Change advanced sharing settings from the top-left corner. From there, select Turn on network discovery. Save changes.
5. Navigate to the folder you want to map and hit OK after selecting it.
6. Confirm your selection and click Finish. You can choose to reconnect to the folder every time you sign in so it's always available. You can even use a different user account to connect to the folder if needed.
7. When you're done, you should see the new drive letter under This PC and will be able to access its contents like you would any other folder. If you want to disconnect the network drive, right-click on it and select Disconnect.
